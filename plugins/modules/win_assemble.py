module: win_assemble
short_description: Assemble configuration files from fragments
description:
- Assembles a configuration file from fragments.
- Often a particular program will take a single configuration file and does not support a
  C(conf.d) style structure where it is easy to build up the configuration
  from multiple sources. M(usace.spk.win_assemble) will take a directory of files that can be
  local or have already been transferred to the system, and concatenate them
  together to produce a destination file.
- Files are assembled in string sorting order.
- Puppet calls this idea I(fragments).
version_added: '1.0.0'
options:
  src:
    description:
    - An already existing directory full of source files.
    type: path
    required: true
  dest:
    description:
    - A file to create using the concatenation of all of the source files.
    type: path
    required: true
  backup:
    description:
    - Create a backup file (if V(true)), including the timestamp information so
      you can get the original file back if you somehow clobbered it
      incorrectly.
    type: bool
    default: false
  delimiter:
    description:
    - A delimiter to separate the file contents.
    type: str
  remote_src:
    description:
    - If V(false), it will search for src at originating/master machine.
    - If V(true), it will go to the remote/target machine for the src.
    type: bool
    default: true
  regexp:
    description:
    - Assemble files only if the given regular expression matches the filename.
    - If not set, all files are assembled.
    - Every V(\\) (backslash) must be escaped as V(\\\\) to comply to YAML syntax.
    - If O(remote_src=false), uses L(Python regular expressions,https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html).
    - If O(remote_src=true), uses L(.NET regular expressions,https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/base-types/regular-expressions).
    type: str
  ignore_hidden:
    description:
    - A boolean that controls if hidden files will be included or not.
    - Which files are considered hidden depends on the source location.
    - If O(remote_src=false), files that start with a '.' are considered hidden.
    - If O(remote_src=true), files that have the hidden attribute on supported
      filesystems on the remote/target system are considered hidden.
    type: bool
    default: false
  header:
    description:
    - Content to place at the top of the generated file.
    type: str
  footer:
    description:
    - Content to place at the bottom of the generated file.
    type: str
  decrypt:
    description:
    - This option controls the autodecryption of source files using vault.
    - This is ignored if O(remote_src=true).
    type: bool
    default: true
attributes:
    action:
      support: full
    async:
      support: none
    bypass_host_loop:
      support: none
    check_mode:
      support: full
    diff_mode:
      support: full
    platform:
      support: partial
      platforms: windows
    safe_file_operations:

      support: partial
      details: Only supported when O(remote_src=false).
notes:
- It is recommended that backslashes C(\) are used instead of C(/) when dealing
  with remote paths.
